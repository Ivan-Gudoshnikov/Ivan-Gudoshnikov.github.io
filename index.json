The solution of such an evolution problem is a function $t\\mapsto (e(t),p(t))$, where $e_i(t)$ is the elastic elongation and $p_i(t)$ is the relaxed length of spring $i$,  defined on $[t_0,\\infty)$ by the initial condition $(e(t_0),p(t_0))$.  After we rigorously convert the problem into a Moreau sweeping process with a moving polyhedron $C(t)$ in a vector space $E$ of dimension $d,$ it becomes natural to expect (based on a result by Krejci) that the elastic component $t\\mapsto e(t)$ always converges to a $T$-periodic function as $t\\to\\infty$. The achievement of this paper is in spotting a class of loadings where the Krejci's limit doesn't depend on the initial condition $(e(t_0),p(t_0))$ and so all the trajectories approach the same $T$-periodic regime. The proposed class of sweeping processes is the one for which the normals of any $d$ different facets of the moving polyhedron $C(t)$ are linearly independent. We further link this geometric condition to mechanical properties of the given network of springs. We discover that the normals of any $d$ different facets of the moving polyhedron $C(t)$ are linearly independent, if the number of displacement-controlled loadings is two less the number of nodes of the given network of springs and when the magnitude of the stress-controlled loading is sufficiently large (but admissible). The result can be viewed as an analogue of the high-gain control method for elastoplastic systems. In continuum theory of plasticity, the respective result is known as Frederick-Armstrong theorem.","tags":["Moreau's Sweeping Process","Elastoplasticity","Stability","Networks","Convex polytopes"],"title":"Stabilization of the response of cyclically loaded lattice spring models with plasticity","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ivan Gudoshnikov","Mikhail Kamenskii","Oleg Makarenkov","Natalia Voskovskaia"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1586476800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1586476800,"objectID":"5f261c213f3584d8de4c632f6d505625","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/gkmv/","publishdate":"2019-04-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/gkmv/","section":"publication","summary":" ","tags":["Moreau's Sweeping Process","Stability","Elastoplasticity","Networks","Convex polytopes"],"title":"One-period stability analysis of polygonal sweeping processes with application to an elastoplastic model","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ivan Gudoshnikov","Oleg Makarenkov"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1583280000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1583280000,"objectID":"e35a19ef827699b72b51f97ec182f413","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/gm-2/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/gm-2/","section":"publication","summary":"Networks of elastoplastic springs (elastoplastic systems) have been linked to differential equations with polyhedral constraints in the pioneering paper by Moreau (1974). Periodic loading of an elastoplastic system, therefore, corresponds to a periodic motion of the polyhedral constraint. According to Krejci (1996), every solution of a sweeping process with a periodically moving constraint asymptotically converges to a periodic orbit.  Understanding whether such an asymptotic periodic orbit is unique or there can be an entire family of asymptotic periodic orbits (that form a periodic attractor) has been an open problem since then. Since suitable small perturbation of a polyhedral constraint seems to be always capable to destroy a potential family of periodic orbits, it is expected that none of potential periodic attractor is  structurally stable. In the present paper we give a simple example to prove that even though the periodic attractor (of non-stationary periodic solutions) can be destroyed by little perturbation of the moving constraint, the periodic attractor resists perturbations of the physical parameters of the mechanical model (i.e. the parameters of the network of elastoplastic springs).","tags":["Moreau's Sweeping Process","Elastoplasticity","Stability","Networks"],"title":"Structurally stable families of periodic solutions in sweeping processes of networks of elastoplastic springs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lakmi Niwanthi Wadippuli Achchige","Oleg Makarenkov","Ivan Gudoshnikov"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1583020800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1583020800,"objectID":"b4f227181ea9e9638996c88f69fb45f2","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/amg2020/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/amg2020/","section":"publication","summary":" ","tags":["Moreau's Sweeping Process","Prox-regular sets","Stability"],"title":"Global asymptotic stability of nonconvex sweeping processes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mikhail Kamenskii","Ivan Gudoshnikov"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1533340800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1533340800,"objectID":"5f8b9978ad4499e91901ccf60428dbc7","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/kg2018/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kg2018/","section":"publication","summary":" ","tags":["Partially Ordered Spaces","$C_0$-semigroups","Stability"],"title":"On the stability of perturbed semigroups in partially ordered Banach spaces","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"In late 1960\u0026rsquo;s French mathematician J.-J.
