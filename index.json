We describe abstract frameworks for linear elasticity, elasticity-perfect plasticity, and elasticity-plasticity with hardening in terms of adjoint linear operators and convert them to equivalent formulations in terms of differential inclusions (the sweeping process in particular). Within such frameworks, we consider several manually solvable examples of discrete and continuous models. Despite their simplicity, the examples show how for discrete models with perfect plasticity it is possible to find the evolution of stress and strain (elongation), yet continuum models within the same framework may not possess a function-valued strain. Although some examples with such a phenomenon are already known, we demonstrate that it may appear due to displacement loading. The central idea of the paper is to explain the loss of strain regularity in the dual formulation by the lack of additivity of the normal cones to stress constraints and the failure of constraint qualifications for them. In contrast to perfect plasticity, models with hardening are known to be well-solvable for strains. We show that more advanced constraint qualifications can help to distinguish between those cases, and, in the case of hardening, ensure the additivity of the normal cones, which means the existence of a function-valued strain rate.","tags":["Moreau's Sweeping Process","Elastoplasticity"],"title":"Regularity lost: The fundamental limitations and constraint qualifications in the problems of elastoplasticity","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ivan Gudoshnikov","Yang Jiao","Oleg Makarenkov","Duyu Chen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1764547200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1764547200,"objectID":"42b7f410a711baa5f632dd3105129d70","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/2025-phys-rev-e/","publishdate":"2025-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2025-phys-rev-e/","section":"publication","summary":"Disordered network materials abound in both nature and synthetic situations while rigorous analysis of their nonlinear mechanical behaviors remains challenging. The purpose of this paper is to connect the mathematical framework of the sweeping process originally proposed by Moreau to the generic class of lattice spring models that incorporate plasticity. We derive the equations of quasistatic evolution of an elastic–perfectly plastic lattice and relate them to concepts from rigidity theory and structural mechanics. Then we explicitly construct a sweeping process and provide numerical schemes to find the evolution of stresses in the model. In particular, we develop a highly efficient “leapfrog” computational framework that allows us to rigorously track the progression of plastic events in the system based on the sweeping process theory. The utility of our framework is demonstrated by analyzing the elastoplastic stresses in a novel class of disordered network materials exhibiting the property of hyperuniformity, in which the (normalized) infinite-wavelength density fluctuations associated with the distribution of network nodes are completely suppressed. We find enhanced mechanical properties such as increasing stiffness, yield strength, and tensile strength as the degree of hyperuniformity of the material system increases. Our results have implications for optimal network material design and our event-based framework can be readily generalized to nonlinear stress analysis of other heterogeneous material systems.","tags":["Moreau's Sweeping Process","Elastoplasticity","Networks","Convex polytopes"],"title":"Sweeping process approach to stress analysis in elastoplastic lattice spring models with applications to network materials","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ivan Gudoshnikov"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1756944000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1756944000,"objectID":"80262de7e9861450c195dad8a5b87af3","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/2026-math-eng/","publishdate":"2026-02-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2026-math-eng/","section":"publication","summary":"Plasticity with softening and fracture mechanics lead to ill-posed mathematical problems due to the loss of monotonicity.

Krejčí’s theorem states that a sweeping process with periodic input has a global attractor which consists of periodic solutions, and all such periodic solutions follow the same trajectory up to a parallel translation. We show that in the case of polyhedral sweeping process with periodic input the attractor has to be a convex polyhedron χ of a fixed shape. We provide examples of elastoplastic spring models leading to structurally stable situations where χ is a one- or two- dimensional polyhedron. In general, an attractor of a polyhedral sweeping process may be either exponentially stable or finite-time stable and the main result of the paper consists of sufficient conditions for finite-time stability of the attractor, with upper estimates for the settling time.

The solution of such an evolution problem is a function $t\\mapsto (e(t),p(t))$, where $e_i(t)$ is the elastic elongation and $p_i(t)$ is the relaxed length of spring $i$,  defined on $[t_0,\\infty)$ by the initial condition $(e(t_0),p(t_0))$.  After we rigorously convert the problem into a Moreau sweeping process with a moving polyhedron $C(t)$ in a vector space $E$ of dimension $d,$ it becomes natural to expect (based on a result by Krejci) that the elastic component $t\\mapsto e(t)$ always converges to a $T$-periodic function as $t\\to\\infty$. The achievement of this paper is in spotting a class of loadings where the Krejci's limit doesn't depend on the initial condition $(e(t_0),p(t_0))$ and so all the trajectories approach the same $T$-periodic regime. The proposed class of sweeping processes is the one for which the normals of any $d$ different facets of the moving polyhedron $C(t)$ are linearly independent. We further link this geometric condition to mechanical properties of the given network of springs. We discover that the normals of any $d$ different facets of the moving polyhedron $C(t)$ are linearly independent, if the number of displacement-controlled loadings is two less the number of nodes of the given network of springs and when the magnitude of the stress-controlled loading is sufficiently large (but admissible). The result can be viewed as an analogue of the high-gain control method for elastoplastic systems. In continuum theory of plasticity, the respective result is known as Frederick-Armstrong theorem.","tags":["Moreau's Sweeping Process","Elastoplasticity","Stability","Networks","Convex polytopes"],"title":"Stabilization of the response of cyclically loaded lattice spring models with plasticity","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ivan Gudoshnikov","Mikhail Kamenskii","Oleg Makarenkov","Natalia Voskovskaia"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1586476800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1586476800,"objectID":"bdab6978fbff6914967f1a18cc20e905","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/2020-math-model-nat-phenom/","publishdate":"2019-04-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2020-math-model-nat-phenom/","section":"publication","summary":" ","tags":["Moreau's Sweeping Process","Stability","Elastoplasticity","Networks","Convex polytopes"],"title":"One-period stability analysis of polygonal sweeping processes with application to an elastoplastic model","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ivan Gudoshnikov","Oleg Makarenkov"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1583280000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1583280000,"objectID":"b809ced6a43c1cfadd86138458f80727","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/2020-physica-d/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2020-physica-d/","section":"publication","summary":"Networks of elastoplastic springs (elastoplastic systems) have been linked to differential equations with polyhedral constraints in the pioneering paper by Moreau (1974). Periodic loading of an elastoplastic system, therefore, corresponds to a periodic motion of the polyhedral constraint. According to Krejci (1996), every solution of a sweeping process with a periodically moving constraint asymptotically converges to a periodic orbit.  Understanding whether such an asymptotic periodic orbit is unique or there can be an entire family of asymptotic periodic orbits (that form a periodic attractor) has been an open problem since then. Since suitable small perturbation of a polyhedral constraint seems to be always capable to destroy a potential family of periodic orbits, it is expected that none of potential periodic attractor is  structurally stable. In the present paper we give a simple example to prove that even though the periodic attractor (of non-stationary periodic solutions) can be destroyed by little perturbation of the moving constraint, the periodic attractor resists perturbations of the physical parameters of the mechanical model (i.e. the parameters of the network of elastoplastic springs).","tags":["Moreau's Sweeping Process","Elastoplasticity","Stability","Networks"],"title":"Structurally stable families of periodic solutions in sweeping processes of networks of elastoplastic springs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lakmi Niwanthi Wadippuli Achchige","Oleg Makarenkov","Ivan Gudoshnikov"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1583020800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1583020800,"objectID":"aae6d944f3d67ca464ceae71df9bb3ca","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/2020-discrete-continuous-dyn-syst-ser-b/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2020-discrete-continuous-dyn-syst-ser-b/","section":"publication","summary":" ","tags":["Moreau's Sweeping Process","Prox-regular sets","Stability"],"title":"Global asymptotic stability of nonconvex sweeping processes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mikhail Kamenskii","Ivan Gudoshnikov"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1533340800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1533340800,"objectID":"80f04eb1c66645155cbf8fb97c71169a","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/2018-j-math-sci/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2018-j-math-sci/","section":"publication","summary":" ","tags":["Partially Ordered Spaces","$C_0$-semigroups","Stability"],"title":"On the stability of perturbed semigroups in partially ordered Banach spaces","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"In late 1960\u0026rsquo;s French mathematician J.-J.
