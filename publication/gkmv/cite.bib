abstract = "We offer a finite-time stability result for Moreau sweeping processes on the plane with periodically moving polyhedron. The result is used to establish the convergence of stress evolution of a simple network of elastoplastic springs to a unique cyclic response in just one cycle of the external displacement-controlled cyclic loading. The paper concludes with an example showing that smoothing the vertices of the polyhedron makes finite-time stability impossible."
